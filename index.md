I believe many of us share this same experience of getting into something rather late, feeling depressed, out-of-place, even resentful for missing out the would-be opportunities. 

> If only I had picked the right college and the right program, if only I had invested in Bitcoin earlier in 08, if only I had started my own Taobao store 10 years back, etc. etc.. 

Well, the list could be endless, but all those assumptions of the past just simply makes no fricking sense. 

> We need to move on.


"**The Latecomer Experience**", a new ID I just came up with five minutes ago which I intend to adopt as my new "anonymous" identity for future cyberspace activities, captures exactly those specific moments.

The name, as you may have guessed, is inspired partly by *The Joe Rogan Experience*, and partly by my own reality as a latecomer to a lot of things, be it in the many facets of my personal life or in my workplace endeavors and struggles.

I recall the other day I read a short article titled *Film Credits* by Prof. Scott Galloway of NYU in which he analyzed the trends of network TV and streaming business in the US, and reflected on his own journey of television/screen appearances. 

Unsurprisingly, I did not retain much of the informative statistics and analysis of that article. But I do remember that he shared at the end of the article, 

>a research result shows that end-of-life regrets aren’t about the mistakes you made, but the risks you didn’t take.

That is the very reason why he is motivated to just go for it, not leaving regret to his death-bed.

Being a nerd from my very early days and now not-so-officially recognized as a tech-savvy at work, I have always had this passion for all the shiny new stuff on/about the internet. I am always one of the early adopters of new services and platform when they came out. I started a lot of things and I unfortunately also leave lots and lots of unfinished work along the trail. 

Time goes fast and life is in session, it always seems difficult to start something new and stick to it. But I am not gonna give up this time without even trying. So here I am, a new kid on the me-media block. And I even got a slogan for my little account, channel, platform, or whatever,

> Just because you're late, doesn't mean you can't have a great experience".

This is also a pinned reminder for myself to just relax and enjoy what I do in my own cyberspace, 
  - don't cry over spilled milk,
  - don't be tortured by FOMO,
  - don't keep up with the Zhang's,
  - don't try to predict what happens next,
  - focus on the moment & develop a carpe diem mindset.
  
But what this latecomer experience are really about? To be absolutely honest, there is no clear roadmap for me at the moment. 

I guess I could certainly write something about the nerdy stuff I do on the daily basis, such as... 

- my productivity setup, apps, tools and workflows.🛠️
- my volnerabilities as a professional, and more so being a student perusing a PhD degree in HigherEd. 👨‍🎓️ 
- my day-to-day wrestling with thickening belly and thinning hair as a 30+ mid-aged (greasy) man .💆‍♂️️

Anyways, I do hope that I could produce quality contents in the days, months and years to come. And this time I will just get the ball rolling without feeling 100% ready.

So if you are among those who are....
- digging productivity tools and hacks
- struggling with your professional or academic life
- learning English or Japanese as a hobby
- trying to have some fun on the internet

I guess, maybe, just maybe, we could sail and even dance together in the journey ahead. 

Great to meet you here and talk to you soon! 

Cheers,

一个还不大会的小白
